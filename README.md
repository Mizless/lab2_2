# Laboratory work â„–2. Option 14.
Calculate the sum of the sign-variable series -(|x(3n-1)|)/(3n-1)!, where x is a matrix of rank k (k and the matrix are given randomly),
n is the number of the summand. Sum is considered calculated if calculation accuracy is not less than t decimal places.
The algorithm must have linear complexity. The multiplication operation is elemental.
